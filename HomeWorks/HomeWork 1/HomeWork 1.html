        <h1>The Matrix</h1>
       
        <h2>About</h2>
       
        <p><b><i>The Matrix</i></b> is an American science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis, and produced by Joel Silver. It stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano and is the first installment in The Matrix franchise. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, The Matrix, created by intelligent machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he "is drawn into a rebellion against the machines" along with other people who have been freed from <i>The Matrix</i>.</p>
      
        <p><i>The Matrix</i> is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally. While some critics have praised the film for its handling of difficult subjects, others have said the deeper themes are largely overshadowed by its action scenes.</p>
        
        <p><i>The Matrix</i> was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was well-received by many critics and won four Academy Awards, as well as other accolades, including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. The Matrix was praised for its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value. The film is considered to be among the best science fiction films of all time, and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2012. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels in 2003, <b>The Matrix Reloaded</b> and <b>The Matrix Revolutions</b>, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis, and produced by Joel Silver. <i>The Matrix</i> franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films.</p>

        <h1>Influences</h1>

        <p><i>The Matrix</i> draws from and alludes to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy, including the ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and Judaism.</p>

        <h2>Film and television</h2>

        <p>The pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in <b>Metropolis</b>, and the work of M. C. Escher. and can be seen in <b>Welcome to Paradox</b> Episode 4 "News from D Street" from a 1986 short story of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998 on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by "the code man" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making <i>The Matrix</i>. Reviewers have also commented on similarities between <i>The Matrix</i> and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City, and The Truman Show. The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted. As in the film, <i>The Matrix</i> of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. The action scenes of <i>The Matrix</i> were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.</p>

        <h1>Legacy</h1>

        <p><i>The Matrix</i> had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of <i>The Matrix</i> created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in <b>X-Men</b> (2000) and <b>Charlie's Angels</b> (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on <b>Daredevil</b> (2003). The Matrix's Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as <b>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</b> (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.</p>
        
        <p>Following <i>The Matrix</i>, films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including <b>Max Payne</b>, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as "bullet time". It was also the defining game mechanic of the game <b>Superhot</b> and its sequels.</p>

        <p>The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: <br>
            - <b>Male Gigolo</b> (1999), <b>Scary Movie</b> (2000), <b>Shrek</b> (2001), <b>Kung Pow! Enter the Fist</b> (2002), <b>Lastikman</b> (2003); <br>
            - <b>Marx Reloaded</b> in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; <br>
            - in video games such as <b>Conker's Bad Fur Day</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air: <br>
            - <b>Charlie's Angels</b> (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; <br>
            - <b>Equilibrium</b> (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; <br>
            - <b>Night Watch</b> (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by <i>The Matrix</i> and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made <b>Wanted</b> (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air;
